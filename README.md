 I. HomeworkApp - Basilescu Bogdan
=========================================================================

  This application was developed only by me, since I was new to Android and I wanted to get more familiarized with the
programming patterns and the language itself. I usually prefer to work in teams, because I believe that a team if 
it correctly coordinated can achieve much more than a single person.
  
  Introduction: 
  
  My application is called HomeworkApp, since it was homework. I originally called it TrainingApp, because it was
more like a fun and interesting training rather than a pressing homework.
  
  Implementation: 
  
    After getting to know the programming patterns, for example how to link the xml to activities and how
  to operate with different methods, It was pretty simple to continue with the same structural implementation. As an 
  example : creating a java class which extends Activity, creating xml page for that particular activity and after that
  adding defined names in values/strings or defined dimensions in values/dimens. I also added a new directory called "raw" for storing
  the mp3 files which I used. I added photos in drawable as well for the splash,login,welcome etc xml files. 
    Since we had various tasks I wanted to concentrate all of them in one main Activity - Welcome, in order to have access
  to every one of them from a single Activity.
  
  Conclusions:
  
    Regarding the application, I have no conclusions to draw because every task was pretty much clear, but with respect to
  the attitute which I have gained..I may say that working in Android in fun and I can't wait to finish the exam session
  and start working on a real application which I have in mind.

a) Instructions :

1.Building the Android Project using Android Studio

  -download the .zip archive from the gitHub Repository
  -unzip the archive
  -Import Project by Selecting the Gradle project, moreover by selecting the build.gradle from the ParseStarterProject
  -the project should work fine if the same gradle version is used on your computer

2.Running the Android Project
  
  -Run the project using an device with at least 4.1.2 Android and also connect the device to a wireless or to an internet connection

b)Presenting the application :

    The application starts with a Splash Activity which is what I prefer to call "the loading moment" and also the moment
  where companies put their logo or a picture with the App's logo. 
    After 8 seconds the MainActivity starts and based on the previous session of the app, it starts the Welcome Activity if 
  the user is still logged into the application or it starts the LoginSignUpActivity where you have the possibility to Register a New User 
  or to simply Login with an existing user.
    After Logging In into the applcation, the Welcome - activity starts and this is actually the main Activity of the application
  also known as the place where you can access all the other Activities: ChangePasswordActivity,LinksListActivity,WeatherActivity,
    DynamicLayoutActivity and also there is a button which you can press to listen to Lord of the Rings Medley(one of my favourite
  soundtracks from LOTR). It also has a LogOut button in order to deconnect the current user.
    The ChangePass Activity - changes the password of the current user with a new one, LinksListActivity gives you access to
  a list of useful links, the DynamicLayoutActivity shows you "the power" of a DynamicalLayout and the WeatherActivity gives you
  the weather according to a City.
